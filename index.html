        <h3>Business Operations</h3>
      <p>Business operations is about systemizing the methods of your business and organizing the way your system operates.
          Operations translate the business results into meaningful data to describe the past, why it happened, predict the future,
          and prescribe solutions to alter the future. This process requires systems, methodologies, talent, and continuous improvement.
          Optimizing the business  operations is best approached with a data driven and analytical mindset.

        <h3>Customer Support & Technical Support</h3>
      <p>Viet has experience assisting customers in a fast-paced environment with a SaaS (Software as a Service).
          Helping customers with their technical problems pushed his problem solving and critical thinking skills.
          Customers come with all kinds of problems where nobody knows the cause of them. His approach was to use the
          troubleshooting method to systemize the process. We would ask certain troubleshooting questions to narrow down
          the reason to what caused the problem. Solving problems and educating the customers on the solutions empowers
          all parties involved to utilize the programs to their fullest potential.
